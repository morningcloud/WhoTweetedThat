# Who-Tweeted-That?
It is an intra-class Kaggle competition among 450 students. The problem requires identification of the author of tweets.
Two datasets provided, a training set containing almost 10,000 authors and approximately 330,000 tweets and another unlabelled test set.
The main goal is to use and evaluate statistical machine learning approaches that can effectively identify the authors of tweets in the given test set. 
Our team was the runner up in this competition.
